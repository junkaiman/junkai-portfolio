> Demo page for the biological age prediction project led by [Prof. Chenkai Wu and his team](http://www.chenkaiwu.com/) at Duke Kunshan University. The page receives user's inputs of physiological data and returns with a predicted biological age. Open service to individuals and healthcare organizations to monitor elderly patients' health conditions.

The project is held under Global Health Research Center and funded by local government.

I took the responsibility of server deployment, frontend page design, and the backend system development to connect pre-trained PyCaret model with user's input. Backend system is written in Django, and vue.js is used to build the front-end webpage. Then the project with its all dependencies are packed into a docker image.

## Technical Architecture
Vue.js as front-end, and Django as backend. Using uWSGI to improve the maximum concurrent capacity. And Docker is used to containerize the App for faster deployment.
