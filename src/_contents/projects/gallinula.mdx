## Gallinula - Forum

Gallinula Forum is a semi-closed social platform, which is only open to DKU community members. Registration is based on the campus email address. Community content is kept private by default, but community members have the option to share it externally.

It inherits most of the functions of mainstream social media (Twitter), including posting, commenting, reposting, favorites, and sharing posts to other platforms; posting pictures, voting, and topic discussions. At the same time, it also supports private chats, groups Chat, email alerts and more.

Gallinula Forum is derived from the open source project Mastodon. Similar projects include: closed forums in famous universities such as Tsinghua Closed Forum (https://thu.closed.social) and SJTU Closed Forum (https://sjtu.closed.social). Based on the distributed feature of Mastodon, content between different sites can be shared with each other, and users of different sites can communicate with each other. After the Gallinula platform has accumulated a certain number of people and the alumni network of Duke Kunshan University has grown, we can negotiate to open access to other university forums, allowing students to communicate with friends across servers.

## Gallinula - thewall
[thewall](/projects/thewall) is an online message board for DKU members to anonymously publish their messages & appeals.

A simple and elegant one-page Web App showing campus shuttle bus schedule and the countdown of the upcoming one.

### Design Motivation
  DKU’s shuttle bus schedule is published as a pdf file and transferred to students through DKU email list. Some students will print it out or save it as a screenshot in their photo albums. However, most students find it inefficient when they want to check the next shuttle’s leaving time immediately. To improve its efficiency, several solutions were came out by Gallinula. Last year, I designed a Siri Shortcut for users to quickly acquire the next shuttle’s time by simply asking “Hey Siri, Next Shuttle”. Now the voice service is updated to a fully functioned Web App with GUI front-end.


### Highlights
- Minimalism design
- Countdown of most recent shuttle bus
- Dynamically exhibit the full shuttle schedule by selecting location/destination

### Technical Details
  “Next Shuttle” is a pure front-end App developed using the Vue.js. I Adopted the idea of data & service separation. The data of Shuttle Bus Schedule can be updated regularly via a json file on remote web server.
