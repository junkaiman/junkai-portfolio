> ✨Insta UI is a web application that utilizes large language models to generate UI code based on user input.
> Users can preview the interface in real time, modify the UI by editing the generated code or providing additional inputs.
> The application also saves the user's activity, allowing them to continue from where they left off when they reopen the web app.
