### Engineering Overhaul and Infrastructure Revamp

My initial focus was on modernizing the engineering infrastructure to enhance agility and scalability. Key initiatives included:

- **Monorepo Transition**: Consolidated multiple complex repositories into a unified monorepo, streamlining development workflows and improving code maintainability.

- **Tech Stack Modernization**: Migrated the frontend from Vue.js to Next.js and transitioned the database from MySQL to Supabase, aligning with modern startup technologies for better performance and scalability.

- **Infrastructure Enhancement**: Leveraged AWS services alongside in-house machines to build a robust and flexible infrastructure. Implemented Coolify for continuous integration and deployment, facilitating seamless development cycles.

- **CI/CD and Testing Improvements**: Established comprehensive CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, reinforced software testing protocols, and instituted rigorous code review workflows to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Team Leadership and Project Management

Beyond technical contributions, I played a pivotal role in team development and project coordination:

- **Internship Program Management**: Recruited and mentored three interns, guiding them through full-stack development projects and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

- **Project Oversight**: Managed project timelines and deliverables, ensuring alignment with OfSpectrum's mission to protect and authenticate voice content.

### Reflections on the Experience

Working with OfSpectrum has been an enriching experience, allowing me to contribute to a mission-driven organization at the intersection of AI and voice security. The opportunity to lead technical transformations and mentor emerging talent has been both challenging and rewarding.

As OfSpectrum continues to innovate in the realm of voice protection, I am proud to have played a role in laying the technical foundation for its future advancements.
