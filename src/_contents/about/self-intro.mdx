Hi, I'm Junkai Man, a master's student at [Brown University](https://brown.edu) majoring in Computer Science, with a passion for Full-Stack Development and AI products. 

I enjoy the entire process of designing, prototyping, and deploying software solutions to end users, ensuring they have the best possible user experience.

In 2020, I founded [Gallinula](https://dku-gallinula.github.io), a community that gathers student developers at Duke Kunshan University to code their ideas into reality. In 2023, I started writing a book [MakeYourApp.today](https://MakeYourApp.today) on how to quickly build full-stack applications from scratch.

I love exploring all kinds of new gadgets and following the trend of cutting-edge technologies.
My current interests are in Mixed Reality, Human-AI collaboration, and the future of work.
